                    <p class="article__subsection__content">Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations,
                        staying
                        unrealistically thin, or
                        depriving yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy,
                        improving your
                        health, and boosting your mood.

                        Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the
                        conflicting
                        nutrition and
                        diet advice out there, you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a certain
                        food
                        is good for
                        you, you’ll find another saying exactly the opposite. The truth is that while some specific
                        foods or
                        nutrients have
                        been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall dietary pattern that is most
                        important. The
                        cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace processed food with real food whenever
                        possible.
                        Eating food that
                        is as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a huge difference to the way you
                        think,
                        look, and feel.

                        By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn how to create—and stick
                        to—a
                        tasty, varied,
                        and nutritious diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your body.</p>

                    <h4 class="article__subsection__title">The fundamentals of healthy eating</h4>
                    <p class="article__subsection__content">While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need
                        a
                        balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain a
                        healthy body. You don’t need to eliminate certain categories of food from your diet, but rather
                        select the healthiest options from each category.

                        Protein gives you the energy to get up and go—and keep going—while also supporting mood and
                        cognitive function. Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, but the
                        latest
                        research suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein, especially as we age. That
                        doesn’t
                        mean you have to eat more animal products—a variety of plant-based sources of protein each day
                        can
                        ensure your body gets all the essential protein it needs.

                        Fat. Not all fat is the same. While bad fats can wreck your diet and increase your risk of
                        certain
                        diseases, good fats protect your brain and heart. In fact, healthy fats—such as omega-3s—are
                        vital
                        to your physical and emotional health. Including more healthy fat in your diet can help improve
                        your
                        mood, boost your well-being, and even trim your waistline.

                        Fiber. Eating foods high in dietary fiber (grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, and beans) can help
                        you
                        stay regular and lower your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. It can also improve
                        your
                        skin and even help you to lose weight.

                        Calcium. As well as leading to osteoporosis, not getting enough calcium in your diet can also
                        contribute to anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties. Whatever your age or gender, it’s
                        vital
                        to include calcium-rich foods in your diet, limit those that deplete calcium, and get enough
                        magnesium and vitamins D and K to help calcium do its job.

                        Carbohydrates are one of your body’s main sources of energy. But most should come from complex,
                        unrefined carbs (vegetables, whole grains, fruit) rather than sugars and refined carbs. Cutting
                        back
                        on white bread, pastries, starches, and sugar can prevent rapid spikes in blood sugar,
                        fluctuations
                        in mood and energy, and a build-up of fat, especially around your waistline.</p>

                    <h4 class="article__subsection__title">Making the switch to a healthy diet</h4>
                    <p class="article__subsection__content">Switching to a healthy diet doesn’t have to be an all or
                        nothing
                        proposition. You don’t have to be perfect, you don’t have to completely eliminate foods you
                        enjoy,
                        and you don’t have to change everything all at once—that usually only leads to cheating or
                        giving up
                        on your new eating plan.

                        A better approach is to make a few small changes at a time. Keeping your goals modest can
                        help you
                        achieve more in the long term without feeling deprived or overwhelmed by a major diet
                        overhaul.
                        Think of planning a healthy diet as a number of small, manageable steps—like adding a salad
                        to your
                        diet once a day. As your small changes become habit, you can continue to add more healthy
                        choices.
